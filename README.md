# About
I'm developing this app in order to study react and acquire more knowledge about it.
I intend to develop something new everyday since I'm taking the #100daysofcode.
The whole log about the features will be displayed on my twitter, make sure you follow me!

# Project
The main idea so far is to choose a pok√©mon and set you up for the adventure.
It's simple but It'll probably get more complex.

# Technologies
React

Packages:
Material-UI / React Router  

# Images
The images are going to change daily as long as I maintain and develop new features;
